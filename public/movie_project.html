<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Back to the Future</h3>
<p>
  This is my favorite movie of all-time as it was so inovative for the time
  period and it's what made me love technology and futuristic cars.
</p>
<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>
  I loved the way it was created and the story mixed my two favorite holidays
  together for one awesome viewing.
</p>

<h3>The Conjuring</h3>
<p>
  This movie was a thrill to see the first time and captivated the imaginations
  of what it's like to go through a haunting.
