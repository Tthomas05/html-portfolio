<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I'm a current student majoring in IT networking. And I'm about 45 credits from
  completing my associates. I have my associate in busines and I'm working on
  getting my CompTIA A+ and CCNA. I'm currently working on HTML and Python
  outside of class to pick up more skills for the month between semesters.

  Within HTML I've worked on learninng about the boilerplate, the tags,
  elements, styling within CSS, and will be working with JavaScript. I'm also
  currently building a website for a small business company that offers
  different types of lawn care services.
